# rollout: Tools for Designing, Simulating, and Analyzing Implementation Rollout Trials

Provides a unified framework for designing, simulating, and analyzing
implementation rollout trials, including stepped wedge, sequential
rollout, head-to-head, multi-condition, and rollout implementation
optimization designs. The package enables users to flexibly specify
rollout schedules, incorporate site-level and nested data structures,
generate outcomes under rich hierarchical models, and evaluate analytic
strategies through simulation-based power analysis. By separating data
generation from model fitting, the tools support assessment of bias,
Type I error, and robustness to model misspecification. The workflow
integrates with standard mixed-effects modeling approaches and the
tidyverse ecosystem, offering transparent and reproducible tools for
implementation scientists and applied statisticians.
