Description: Provides a unified framework for designing, simulating, and analyzing implementation rollout trials, including stepped wedge, sequential rollout, head-to-head, multi-condition, and rollout implementation optimization designs. The package enables users to flexibly specify rollout schedules, incorporate site-level and nested data structures, generate outcomes under rich hierarchical models, and evaluate analytic strategies through simulation-based power analysis. By separating data generation from model fitting, the tools support assessment of bias, Type I error, and robustness to model misspecification. The workflow integrates with standard mixed-effects modeling approaches and the tidyverse ecosystem, offering transparent and reproducible tools for implementation scientists and applied statisticians.
