A **rollout trial** involves “rolling out” an intervention across
different sites or groups in incremental phases. There are many kinds of
rollout trials (e.g., stepped-wedge, head-to-head, single-arm). The
**rollout package** simulates and evaluates statistical properties
(e.g., power) of a rollout study designs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rollout like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("iancero/rollout")
```

## Workflow

Evaluating the power of a rollout design minimally involves:

1.  Specifying the rollout schedule, expected intervention effects, and
    other sample characteristics (e.g., number of cohorts, sample size
    of each cohort).
2.  Simulating several datasets
3.  Fitting a statistical model to each dataset
4.  Evaluating the statistical properties (e.g., power) of those fitted
    models.

The rollout package provides functions to help you with each of these
steps.

## Specifying rollout schedules and effects

In this step, we specify the rollout schedule and expected effects of
the intervention. For example, we might specify that the intervention
will be rolled out in three phases, each lasting a different amount of
time.[^1]

- A three month **baseline phase**, in which no intervention is applied,
  but data from each participating cohort are collected.
- An two month intervention phase, in which each cohort receives the
  intervention
- A four month sustainment, in which the intervention is no longer
  applied, but data are still collected to evaluate whether the effects
  of the intervention persist beyond its initial application.

Specifying the rollout schedule in the rollout package is done by
creating a named list of phase durations. The names of the list elements
correspond to the names of the phases, and the values correspond to the
duration of each phase in time steps. For example, the rollout schedule
described above would be specified as follows:

``` r
library(rollout)

phase_durations <- list(baseline = 3, intervention = 2, sustainment = 4)
```

Phase effects are specified in a similar way. For example, we might
specify that the intervention has no effect during the baseline phase, a
positive effect during the intervention phase, and a smaller positive
effect during the sustainment phase.

``` r
phase_effects <- list(baseline = 0, intervention = 2, sustainment = 1)
```

## Simulating rollout sample data

In addition to the rollout schedule and expected effects, we need to
specify a few additional simulation parameters. For example, we might
specify that our design is rolled out across 12 cohorts, each with 100
subjects.

``` r
n_cohorts <- 12
subjects_per_cohort <- 100
```

Then, all of our these specifications are then combined into a named
list that is passed to the `simulate_rollout_samples()` function.

``` r
sim_params <- list(
  phase_durations = phase_durations,
  phase_effects = phase_effects,
  n_cohorts = n_cohorts,
  subjects_per_cohort = subjects_per_cohort
)
```

Finally, we simulate several datasets consistent with the rollout
schedule and expected effects. The `simulate_rollout_samples()` function
generates a dataset with the specified number of cohorts and subjects
per cohort, and adds columns for the phase, time, and outcome variables.
The outcome variable is generated by summing the effects of the phase,
time, and random error terms.

``` r
simulated_samples_df <- simulate_rollout_samples(
  n_samples = 100, 
  params = sim_params)
```

[^1]: Note, the rollout package measures time in discrete steps, like
    days, months, or years. However, it is agnostic to units, so phases
    all need to be specified on the same time scale (e.g., if
    `baseline = 3` signifies “3 months” in your design, rollout will
    then assume `intervention = 2` is also in months). Lastly, the
    package does not (yet) support continuous time.
