## Introduction: Simulating a Rollout Trial

Rollout trials, including stepped wedge and sequential rollout designs, allow staggered implementation of interventions across sites while collecting outcome data over time. These designs are increasingly used in implementation science because they balance practical, ethical, and statistical considerations when rolling out interventions in real-world settings.

The `rollout` R package supports the design and analysis of rollout trials using simulation-based methods. This tutorial demonstrates how to simulate, analyze, and estimate power for a stepped wedge trial with multiple sites per cohort. The workflow aligns with the following structure:

1. **Define the rollout schedule** across sites and cohorts.
2. **Join unit-level information** such as the number of participants per site.
3. **Specify simulation parameters** for intervention effects and variance components.
4. **Simulate outcomes** under the specified design.
5. **Fit models** across multiple simulated replicates.
6. **Evaluate bias and power** of the planned design.
7. **Visualize results** to inform design decisions.

By following this pipeline, you can efficiently evaluate and optimize your rollout trial design before conducting your study.
