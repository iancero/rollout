# TODO: 

[X] Make the warnings for the final code block clearer

[X] Make sure there is is a default for the mean estimate to show up in the model summary (and standard deviation of the estimates / standard error)

[X] Fix DEPENDS in NAMESPACE so that all of the right sub-packages are installed automatically (broom.mixed, lmerTest, pbapply, future). Hendricks ran into this problem last time 

[ ] Make some visualization functions, especially one that will illustrate the rollout schedule by cohort

[ ] See file "Fix this for Hendricks"
